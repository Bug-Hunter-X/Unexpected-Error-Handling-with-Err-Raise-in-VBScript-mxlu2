This repository demonstrates a subtle error in VBScript's error handling when using `Err.Raise`. The `bug.vbs` file shows a function that raises a custom error if input parameters are empty. However, this error might not always be caught correctly by the calling function, leading to unpredictable behavior. The `bugSolution.vbs` file offers a solution for more robust error handling.
